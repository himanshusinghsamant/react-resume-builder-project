       <p>Shivaji was profoundly devout and had grown up hearing Hindu texts read aloud by his mother, Jijabai. Despite being a devoted Hindu, Shivaji was liberal and supported other faiths.

Raigad served as the capital when Shivaji established the Maratha Empire, which he later expanded by seizing successive forts. To build his empire, he engaged in conflict with the Mughal Empire, the British Empire, and other feudal powers.

Battles | He fought many battles, like the Battle of Pratapgad. On November 10, 1659, he engaged in combat with the Adilshahi commander Afzal Khan and the soldiers of the Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at the town of Satara in Maharashtra, India. This battle was majorly fought on foot and with artillery like camels, elephants, horses etc.

Another example would be the Battle of Kolhapur. It was a battle fought on December 28, 1659, between the Maratha Chhatrapati Shivaji and the Adilshahi armies close to Kolhapur, Maharashtra. It is estimated that both armies had an equal number of soldiers in the battle. But Shivaji used smart tactics to fight and win this battle and conquer Kolhapur.

Also, the Battle of Pavan Khind, fought on July 13, 1660, near Fort Vishalgad, close to Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India, between Siddi Masud of Adilshah and the Maratha Sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande.</p>
